3,magic duel moderate entertainment dont mind huge grind dont mind throwing money problem case problem buggy game dont recommend glitch dealing currency system honestly currency purchasable real money last thing game problem withhowever personally recommend negatives1 many hour spent game never encountered ai didnt play land first five six turn dont know ai cheat suspect land starved 4 land 20 game using deck given surely ai using similar composition lead 22 get used hitting restart game story mode grind currency bit faster headtohead game completing entire story mode including tutorial enough currency wait buy six booster pack thing sadder significantly faster grinding headtohead games3 completed quest seen 40 gold checked move towards currency total currency added happened recently minute ago wasting time creating new deck finish quest rewarded safely recommend game nearly anyonei played earlier magic title surprisingly wait unsurprisingly company worst one

27,love magic best collectable card game imo however company cant seem release online game work really wish didnt crash constantly really wish could stay connected server cause id love play
28,magic gathering game ive enjoyed 15 year dotp series except last year one ive quite enjoyed despite shortcoming ive looked forward developer could next iteration well developer done poor job others mentioned series regressed losing feature series obviously mimicking hearthstone bad job main gripe 15g per win 20g v online opponent 150g buy booster pack 6 card discount buying pack bulk plus weak card pool rares even importantly common uncommons every archetype aggro midrange control ramp combo mean long rather uninteresting grind frustrating beginner experience much fun use limited weak uninteresting pool card interesting deck played ai ai improved series four year doesnt seem worked removed different gameplay mode challenge campaign cant get gold 2 headed giant game put feature penalize player enjoy feature player already slowly grind gold make sense cant save accountgame data across platform excuse lame hearthstone care iphone ipad steam console create account one discourages player long term play investing game gold pack major major flaw play 3040 minute game online opponent right winning opp quitsdisconnects lose connection game gain gold win happened payout bad enough without disconnect solutionsincrease amount gold per win 25g quest give least 75g massive worldwide coop quest even worldwide quest today 40g reward even 13 pack increase booster pack least 8 card per pack preferably 910 whatever coding make cross platform compatible hire new developer give free pack customer grief server letdown cost money make customer base feel listened happy happy loyal customer good thing
29,pay win involves grinding real cash get anything common im real paper magic player tell game designed frustrate pay win youll feel stupid playing nothing common computer human player playing best card dont give enough card construct basic deck download promotional crap play real magic shop others
30,fun game potential great quite ill give strong good thoughgetting card grind taken step improve daily reward adding easier mean getting coin expect open one maybe two pack per day play couple hour spend little money fun go way building lot new deck learn new card scheme fast
31,first thing want say enjoy game bug big issue recommend people asked cant play two headed giant invited team mate try go random opponent without splitting u reason top almost everytime try one one friend wont let u join tell u reconnect multiplayer server even numerous game restarts complaint fact game auto skip phase assumes cant anything come devs fix kinda stuff
32,hi guy hope busy daily grind today downloaded played magic tbh honest havent really played game except sister rare card thats story another day coworker champ never got watch play much work anyway review game really teach play magic trust youll learn play magic like notfor getting see done eye opener mean read magic manual came box still get itno reading jsut play thru game teach course game ai could use little tweaking fa using card like use special card hey least dont go magic store watch guy play day anyway here game play guy usual artist wizard coast working overtime artwork pretty good like owning card real close enough least youll learn play magic use card uhm maybe doesnt ask rare card first
33,game good potential rubbishly executedmatchmaking usually completely fails game frequently informs yay youve awarded 400 coin actually got timer button another disaster especially youre cast multiple spell youre waiting opponent read effect suddenly find press button two second usually good strategy lie ruin afterwardsthe interface pretty messy menu overlap button get stuck icon sometimes glitchedthis could good game mtg failed since unfinished poorly tested hopefuly get better future
34,magic duel good teaching tool people wanting learn play magic gathering first campaign play gideon take player step step turn teach basic mechanic like flying vigilance later also teach new player build deck using assisted deck builder even experienced player enjoyed going magic lore playing jace origin sorin soi thats pretty much fun ended methe con game like playing giant game sealed multiplayer hundred people go forever never get new pool card cant make proper vampire tribal deck cant even buy single buy pack origin forward thats itthis game beginner isnt recommended average mtg player though tought friend play using game theyre hooked game theyve gone bought paper edh deck hold 4 player commander twice week definetly recommend wanting learn play wanting teach friend play
35,immensely frustrating incredibly tedious make grind teeth fine powder recommended hate fellow human 1010 highly faithful videogame version mtg

40,frequent crash midgame recommend product current state minor quibble audio tutorial length disabling option teaching phase poor quality ai two headed ogre mode lack reward well impressive booster cost also detract experience
41,frequent matchmaking conectivity issue forced play uncreative deck archetype order acquire game currency progression much slower previous installment disappointing
42,used play mtg friend lot younger enough time oportunities recently time ago found magic duel steam quite like possibility return great game experiment new card combination relaxpros free play money investment actually required build expand various deck recent inclusion battle zendikar expansion expanded card pool quite nicely fast easy intuitive control story mode quest offer additional motivagtion variabilitycons technical glitch like nonappearing title screen ingame currency quest arriving directly match nothing dramatic prevalence uw deck among ai opponent known issue probably addressed real card smell nicely taken booster pack digital
