Digimon Masters Online,let start clarifying couple thing dont normally write review steam game offensively bad would genuinely feel guilty providing input warning also dont play steam version cant migrate normal account one server option cash shop item character bound thing garbage filler item loot boxeswhich fill majority cash shopis sell player cant steam problem dont friend server want play dont plan spend money game though actually slightly lower price wouldnt say overall worthwhile customer support entirely based around normal account still receive customer support steam version however definitely convenientthere specific topic want cover itll done harsh way instead going extremely indepth detail ill speaking thing vaguely mostly going immediate detail review mostly focus negative thing game feel overshadow anything going effect gameplay regardless intention playing thing may important dont care competitive stats collecting everything however still definitely major impact playthis game grossly paytowin cash shop target people gambling addiction andor impulsive spending problem want powerful digimon game right omegamon x youll need pay average 10000 loot box unlock requirement dont mean ingame currency currently remotelyreasonable alternative difficult requirement item exclusive 10 loot box 01 drop rate could try trading one ingame currency item amount
